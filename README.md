# Comparative a run-time analysis of object-oriented languages and functional language

This is an experimental study that I carried for British Conference of Undergraduate Research 2018. 

## Abstract:

Many programming languages exist today: C, C++, Python, Ruby, Haskell, Java, and so on. With so many languages, how does a software engineer decide which one to use for a project? Furthermore, there are a couple different programming paradigms: imperative, logical, object-oriented, and functional. So long, programming paradigms have been a key consideration for which programming language should be used for the task. However, in recent years, modern-high level languages have started having functional programming features. As a consequence, modern programming languages are becoming more like hybrid language. In an ideal world, a programming language should be chosen based on its performance. 

There is a wide range of research that has analysed run-time of sorting algorithm, execution time of sorting algorithms that implemented in different programming languages. However, it lacks a comparative study that analysed the performance of pure functional programming language and imperative programming language. Also, some of the programming languages which have already functional programming feature, such as lambda expressions, has not been analysed thoroughly yet.

So in this study, run-time analysis of basic, yet an industry standard, sorting algorithms are going to be presented. Performance of C++, Java, Python, Ruby and Haskell will be analysed with sorting algorithms such as insertion, mergesort, quicksort, heapsort, and selection sort. Also, a performance of sorting algorithms of object-oriented languages that have functional programming features. To conclude, I hope that this analysis would present a clear view of the performance of selected programming languages.
